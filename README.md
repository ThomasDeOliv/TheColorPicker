# MAUI RGB Color Generator

This is a simple MAUI application built with .NET 8 that allows users to generate colors either by manually adjusting RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components or by generating them randomly. It also provides the associated HEX code for the generated color.

## Features

- **Adjust RGB Values**: Slide bars allow you to adjust the values of Red, Green, and Blue to mix your custom color.
- **Random Color Generation**: Generate a random color with the click of a button.
- **HEX Code Display**: Automatically displays the HEX code for the generated or adjusted color.
